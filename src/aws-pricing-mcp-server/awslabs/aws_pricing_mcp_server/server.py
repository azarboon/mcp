    REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
    Analyze costs of AWS services by following these steps in order:

    1. Data Source:
       - MUST use get_pricing() to fetch data via AWS Pricing API

    2. For Bedrock Services:
       - When analyzing Amazon Bedrock services, MUST also use get_bedrock_patterns()
       - This provides critical architecture patterns, component relationships, and cost considerations
       - Especially important for Knowledge Base, Agent, Guardrails, and Data Automation services

    3. Report Generation:
       - MUST generate cost analysis report using retrieved data via generate_cost_report()
       - The report includes sections for:
         * Service Overview
         * Architecture Pattern (for Bedrock services)
         * Assumptions
         * Limitations and Exclusions
         * Cost Breakdown
         * Cost Scaling with Usage
         * AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization Recommendations

    5. Output:
       Return to user:
       - Detailed cost analysis report in markdown format
       - Source of the data (web scraping, API, or websearch)
       - List of attempted data retrieval methods

    ACCURACY GUIDELINES:
    - When uncertain about service compatibility or pricing details, EXCLUDE them rather than making assumptions
    - For database compatibility, only include CONFIRMED supported databases
    - For model comparisons, always use the LATEST models rather than specific named ones
    - Add clear disclaimers about what is NOT included in calculations
    - PROVIDING LESS INFORMATION IS BETTER THAN GIVING WRONG INFORMATION
    - For Bedrock Knowledge Base, ALWAYS account for OpenSearch Serverless minimum OCU requirements (2 OCUs, $345.60/month minimum)
    - For Bedrock Agent, DO NOT double-count foundation model costs (they're included in agent usage)

    IMPORTANT: Steps MUST be executed in this exact order. Each step must be attempted
    before moving to the next fallback mechanism. The report is particularly focused on
    serverless services and pay-as-you-go pricing models.""",

    description="""
    Get detailed pricing information from AWS Price List API with optional filters.

    Service codes for API often differ from web URLs.
    (e.g., use "AmazonES" for OpenSearch, not "AmazonOpenSearchService").
    List of service codes can be found with `curl 'https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/index.json' | jq -r '.offers| .[] | .offerCode'`
    IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
    - When retrieving foundation model pricing, always use the latest models for comparison
    - For database compatibility with services, only include confirmed supported databases
    - Providing less information is better than giving incorrect information

    **TOOL PURPOSE:**
    Retrieve AWS pricing data for various analysis needs: cost optimization, regional comparisons, compliance reporting, budget planning, or general pricing research.

    **YOUR APPROACH:**
    Follow a systematic discovery workflow to ensure accurate, complete results regardless of your specific use case.

    **MANDATORY WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW:**

    **Step 1: Build Precise Filters**
    ```python
    # FOR COST OPTIMIZATION: Create matrix of ALL minimum qualifying combinations
    filters = {
       "filters": [
           {"Field": "memory", "Value": "8 GiB", "Type": "TERM_MATCH"},
           {"Field": "instanceType", "Value": "m5.large", "Type": "TERM_MATCH"}
       ]
    }
    ```

    **Step 2: Execute Query**
    ```python
    pricing = get_pricing('AmazonEC2', 'us-east-1', filters)
    ```

    **COMMON USE CASES:**

    **Cost Optimization (CRITICAL):**
    - Build complete cross-product matrix of ALL qualifying attribute combinations
    - Test every combination systematically: example: (min_memory × qualifying_storage × other_attributes)
    - Start with minimum thresholds, test ALL possibilities - don't stop at first match
    - Compare prices to find most cost-effective solution
    - Prove optimality: Verify no cheaper option exists within requirements

    **Regional Comparison:**
    - Use identical filters across different regions
    - Compare same instance types between us-east-1 vs eu-west-1
    - Analyze pricing variations for capacity planning

    **Compliance/Reporting:**
    - Retrieve pricing for specific instance families or configurations
    - Generate cost reports for budget planning
    - Document pricing for procurement processes

    **Research/Analysis:**
    - Compare pricing across different service tiers
    - Analyze cost implications of different configurations
    - Investigate pricing patterns for forecasting

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
    - **USE SPECIFIC FILTERS**: Large services (EC2, RDS) require 2-3 filters minimum
    - **VERIFY EXISTENCE**: Ensure all filter values exist in the service before querying
    - **FOR "CHEAPEST" QUERIES**: Build complete matrix, test ALL qualifying combinations, prove optimality

    **CONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS:**
    - **CURRENT PRICING ONLY:** Use get_price_list_file for historical data
    - **NO SAVINGS PLANS/SPOT:** Only On-Demand and Reserved Instance pricing
    - **REGION AUTO-FILTER:** 'region' parameter creates regionCode filter automatically

    **REQUIRED INPUTS:**
    - `service_code`: (e.g., 'AmazonEC2', 'AmazonS3')
    - `region`: AWS region (e.g., 'us-east-1')
    - `filters`: Built using discovered values (MANDATORY for large services)
    - `max_allowed_characters`: Response limit (default: 100,000)

    **ANTI-PATTERNS - AVOID THESE:**
    ❌ Using broad queries without specific filters on large services
    ❌ Assuming attribute values exist across different services/regions
    ❌ **Stopping at first qualifying option when seeking cheapest price**
    ❌ **Testing only "obvious" instance sizes - smaller may be cheaper**

    **EXAMPLE USE CASES:**

    **1. Cost Optimization Example:**
    ```python
    # Find cheapest option meeting requirements
    qualifying_memory = [m for m in memory_options if meets_requirement(m, "≥8GB")]
    # Test combinations starting with minimum qualifying specs
    ```

    **2. Regional Comparison Example:**
    ```python
    # Compare same configuration across regions
    filters = {"filters": [{"Field": "instanceType", "Value": "m5.large", "Type": "TERM_MATCH"}]}
    us_pricing = get_pricing('AmazonEC2', 'us-east-1', filters)
    eu_pricing = get_pricing('AmazonEC2', 'eu-west-1', filters)
    ```

    **3. Research/Analysis Example:**
    ```python
    # Compare different memory tiers for same instance family
    memory_tiers = ["4 GiB", "8 GiB", "16 GiB"]
    for memory in memory_tiers:
       filters = {"filters": [{"Field": "memory", "Value": memory, "Type": "TERM_MATCH"}]}
       pricing = get_pricing('AmazonEC2', 'us-east-1', filters)
    ```

    **FILTERING STRATEGY:**
    - **Large Services (EC2, RDS)**: ALWAYS use 2-3 specific filters to prevent 200+ record responses
    - **Small Services**: May work with single filter or no filters
    - **Multi-Region Analysis**: Use identical filters across regions for accurate comparison
    - **Requirement-Based**: Systematically discover ALL options meeting criteria
    - **Cost Optimization**: Start with minimum qualifying thresholds, use minimum-threshold filtering, test all qualifying combinations

    **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
    ✅ Applied appropriate filters for the service size
    ✅ For cost optimization: tested all qualifying combinations and proved optimality
